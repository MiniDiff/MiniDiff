You can open a project by adding the corresponding project file to DevTools.
If it can not run, you can choose one of two ways to solve it:

1.Import to development tools via Code snippet links.
   First open the development tool, then open the browser to input the link of the corresponding applet; Or click Project - Import - applet snippet - Enter the code after s/in the link

2.Enter your appid:
  a.get your appid
    Upper right corner : project - new  project - On the 'AppID' line Tap 'Test Account' - Copy the AppID that appears as your appid
  b.add appid:
    file path: 	project.config.json
    find:	"appid": "your-appid"  change your-appid to your appid
